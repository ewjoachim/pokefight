# Pokefight

A Python web showcase.

- Front is done with Bulma.
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run start` to watch & rebuild js & sass file
  - `npm run deploy` to generate assets
  - Nothing in place to serve the page... `python3 -m http.server` :)
- Back is... Not done yet :)

(so yes, so far, this Python showcase has exactly 0 lines of Python)
